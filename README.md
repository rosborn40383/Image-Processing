# Image-Processing

Used python 3.11 packages 64 bit, globally I have python 3.9 32 bit so this was also a test of using 64 bit python. 

The purpose of this was to take screenshots of images I had so I could use them as my cpu background. So this takes that list of screenshots, compresses them to more reasonable sizes, 
renames the file name to something (kinda) relevant. Then it has the code for changing my background from this specific image folder and can schedule with windows task.
